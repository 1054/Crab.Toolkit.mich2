getDL07Spec: Usage: to get DL07 SED, please set 1st and 2nd argument to Umin and qPAH, 
getDL07Spec:        e.g. getDL07Spec 1.0 0.35
getDL07Spec:        when getDL07Spec without argument, only vectors tUmn tPAH tDGR are loaded.

getDL07Spec: done!
getDL07Spec: now we have loaded two vectors fLoExCom and fHiExCom, 
getDL07Spec: then the flux for each component is in unit of [mJy]
getDL07Spec: can be derived by: 
getDL07Spec:     fLoExCom = qPDR * fLoExCom * Mdust/dL^2 * (1+z)
getDL07Spec:     fHiExCom = qPDR * fHiExCom * Mdust/dL^2 * (1+z)
getDL07Spec: and the wavelength vector:
getDL07Spec:     lambda = lambda * (1+z)
calc_ltir: L_IR_8_1000 = 4*pi*dL**2 * 1.18755718 Lsun
calc_ltir: L_IR_8_1000 = 4*pi*dL**2 * 4332437.354 Lsun
